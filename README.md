# Project_1

Analyzing a loyalty program in automotive industry

# DESCRIPTION

The objective of our project is to analyze the loyalty programâ€™s information to identify key indicators so that we can propose possible improvements.


# INSTALLATION

No special installation needed. The main code is in Python, Jupyter Notebooks, we used ARIMA library for forecasting.


# File and Data description

data folder : includes  two csv. with the data source

plots folder: secundary plots from the study

Loyalty program- analyzing data.ipynb: MAIN CODE and analysis 

Loyalty program - cleaning, merging and organizing data: cleansing 
and merging data from the data folder

# Data Selection
Sales over 36 months
Maturity of sales per customer
Percentage change of Total Sales and Clients Volume
Category compliance through annual sales
Sales by location (state)
Cost of reward points by category
Compliance vs cost of reward points

# Project Questions
1.- After COVID-19, Is there anything in the methodology of the program that could be modified in order to optimize the number of points given to the customer or increase the level of revenue to deliver points?

	The structure of the category levels is not efficient, a new optimization among them should deliver bigger sales and reduce operations costs. 

Reference Plot: Slide 9, Percentage of sales by category; Expense ratio by category; Compliance by category.

2.- Is there any state or region in Mexico in which we could  grow faster and to the lowest cost?

	Main efforts among all regions in Mexico are not well distributed, a new distribution and expansion would impact directly in bigger sales and reduce operational costs.

Reference Plot: Slide 10, Percentage of sales by zone; Total Sales by region and year.

3.- Is there a better way to distribute categories to optimize the Loyalty Program?

	Reduce number of  categories: 
		Merge in two or three categories
	Overall, propose a new mechanic where less bonus points are granted, and points are more related to sales volume.

Reference Plot: Slide 9, Percentage of sales by category; Expense ratio by category; Compliance by category.

4.- Is there a new opportunity for the company to increase sales through  its loyalty program after the consequences of COVID-19?

	If we had the total company sales (with non-loyalty program members included), we would be able to provide a better analysis for potential opportunities to expand business  in certain regions.
